I'm a coach, trainer, facilitator and strategist based in Wellington, New Zealand. My work is focused on real-time business and event-driven mindset.

I'm like WD-40 for your company's data; I help ease the movement of information, processes and people, bringing them together into a well-oiled machine.

I help businesses stay in control of their data, respond to customer needs faster and optimise use of their IT assets, all while improving compliance, security and resilience.
