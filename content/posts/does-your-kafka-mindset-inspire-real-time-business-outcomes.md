I've been thinking a lot about why some businesses use Apache Kafka as a catalyst for wider change and others adopt it simply as more efficient tooling.

Adopting Apache Kafka as a realtime message bus has its merits and will certainly increase the quality, usefulness and timeliness of data in the organisation.

However, data-driven decisions likely remain out of reach as the data, with only the platform having changed, may well be inconsistent across too many disparate systems and teams.

Many organisations shift this thinking further and consider Kafka as an integration platform. This forces end to end system design thinking to shift and starts to make a positive impact on the resiliency of the emerging architecture.

However, thinking remains platform centric and all too often process bottlenecks appear that plateau the benefits. In some cases these bottlenecks compound and can result in declining data quality over time. Data-driven decisions are starting to become possible but are likely still inconsistent. This lack of trust in the data means parts of the business may be hesitant to act on the decisions.

Most organisations fail to consider the importance of an event-driven data backbone to break through the platform plateau. Those that truly embrace event-driven thinking consistently see significant improvements in data quality, application and platform resiliency and data-driven outcomes.

To make this shift, thinking needs to focus on empowering a community to produce consistent events that collectively describe the state of the business at any given point in time. These events drive near real time insights that impact across the entire business and customer base.

I believe the impact comes down to the mindset of the people involved and sometimes the required mindset shift is too difficult to tackle. I also believe that with the right information anyone can train a new mindset.

So where is your mindset right now? Where would you like it to be?
